# Pricing + Showcase: Plan

Goal: Announce clear prices for small websites and showcase completed work, using minimal changes to the current single‑page site.

Approach (pick one to start):
- Quick win (Node‑only): Add two nodes — Pricing and Portfolio — and use the existing modal + service card system to show content without adding new pages/components.
- Section upgrade: Add a simple Portfolio grid section to the homepage and keep Pricing as a node/modal. Optional second CTA in the hero.

What’s in this folder
- pricing-offers.md — packages, scope, add‑ons, price scaffolds
- site-changes.md — exact file and line references to implement
- landing-page-copy.md — ready‑to‑use copy blocks for pricing
- portfolio-showcase.md — how to write concise case studies + template
- announcement-plan.md — where/how to announce + sample posts
- metrics-and-experiments.md — what to measure and iterate
- implementation-checklist.md — concise, step‑by‑step todo

Outcome
- Visitors can see prices and examples in <1 day of work.
- Minimal code churn by reusing the existing node/modal + service cards.

Notes
- Start with English; add translations later (same pattern as current nodes).
- Keep CTA focused on contact for higher intent; add “View pricing” as a secondary action.
