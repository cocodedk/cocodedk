## 2. New Positioning

### Primary: AI Agent Development & Workflow Automation
Babak Bandpey builds AI agents and automated workflows for Danish SMEs. He connects AI models to real business systems - task management, calendars, codebases, compliance platforms - so businesses can automate repetitive knowledge work.

### Secondary: Cybersecurity & AI Governance
The cybersecurity compliance background (CIS18, DORA, NIS2, ISO27001) positions Babak uniquely: he builds agents that are secure and compliant from day one. This is the differentiator - most AI consultants can't also do security audits.

### Target Customer
Danish SMEs who want to:
- Automate manual processes with AI agents
- Integrate AI into existing business tools (MS Teams, calendars, document systems)
- Get a strategy for where AI agents create value
- Ensure AI usage is compliant with EU regulations
