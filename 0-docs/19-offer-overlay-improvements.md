# Offer Overlay Improvement Options

## Current State Analysis

**Current Offer:**
- Headline: "Campaign: One-pager from 999 DKK + VAT"
- Sub: "Mobile-first, fast delivery, deploy help included."
- Badge: 999 DKK price badge
- CTAs: View Pricing, Call, Email, SMS (4 options)

**Problem:** Overlay hasn't generated any clients/customers.

## Why It Might Not Be Working

1. **Too Generic** - "One-pager from 999 DKK" doesn't communicate unique value
2. **No Urgency/Scarcity** - No reason to act now
3. **Weak Value Proposition** - Doesn't address pain points or outcomes
4. **Decision Paralysis** - 4 CTA buttons create confusion
5. **No Social Proof** - Missing testimonials, client count, or credibility indicators
6. **Intrusive Timing** - Shows on every reload (even if dismissed)
7. **Weak Headline** - "Campaign" sounds like marketing, not a solution

## Improvement Options

### Option 1: Problem-Solution Focus
**Approach:** Lead with the problem, then offer the solution.

**Headline Examples:**
- "Need a Professional Website Fast? Get Online in 48 Hours"
- "Your Business Needs a Modern Website. We Build It in Days, Not Months"
- "Stop Losing Customers to Competitors. Get Your Website Live This Week"

**Sub Examples:**
- "Mobile-optimized, SEO-ready, and deployed. No hassle, just results."
- "From concept to live site in 48-72 hours. Includes hosting setup."

**Benefits:**
- Addresses immediate need
- Creates urgency (48 hours, this week)
- Focuses on outcomes, not price

---

### Option 2: Value-First with Social Proof
**Approach:** Lead with credibility and results.

**Headline Examples:**

- "Need a Professional Website Without the Hassle?"

**Sub Examples:**
- "We build fast, modern websites that convert visitors into customers."
- "Get online in days, not months. Professional results, affordable prices."

**Benefits:**

---

### Option 6: Simplify to Single CTA
**Approach:** Reduce decision paralysis with one clear action.

**Current:** 4 buttons (View Pricing, Call, Email, SMS)
**New:** 1 primary CTA + optional secondary

**Options:**
- Primary: "Get Free Quote" or "Start Your Project"
- Secondary: "View Examples" (link to portfolio)

**Benefits:**
- Reduces confusion
- Clear next step
- Higher conversion potential

---

### Option 7: Change Timing/Behavior
**Approach:** Show overlay at better moments, not every reload.

**Options:**
1. **Scroll-based:** Show after user scrolls 50% of page (shows engagement)
2. **Time-based:** Show after 30 seconds on page (shows interest)
3. **Exit intent:** Show when mouse leaves viewport (catches leaving users)
4. **Return visitor:** Only show to returning visitors (not first-time)
5. **Smart frequency:** Don't show if dismissed in last 7 days (not just this session)

**Benefits:**
- Less intrusive
- Better timing
- Higher relevance

---

### Option 8: Add Trust Indicators
**Approach:** Build credibility with visible trust signals.

**Add Elements:**
- "Trusted by X businesses"
- "5/5 average rating"

- "Money-back guarantee"
- Security badges
- Industry certifications
- "As seen in" media mentions

**Benefits:**
- Reduces risk
- Builds confidence
- Professional appearance

---

### Option 9: Personalize by Visitor Type
**Approach:** Show different offers based on visitor behavior.

**Options:**
- **First-time visitor:** "Welcome! Get 20% off your first project"
- **Returning visitor:** "Welcome back! Ready to start your project?"
- **From portfolio page:** "Like what you see? Let's build yours"
- **From pricing page:** "Ready to get started? Book a free consultation"

**Benefits:**
- More relevant
- Better conversion
- Personalized experience

---

### Option 10: A/B Test Multiple Variations
**Approach:** Test different approaches to find what works.

**Test Variations:**
1. Problem-solution vs. value-first
2. Single CTA vs. multiple CTAs
3. With vs. without social proof

5. Different headlines

## Notes

- Current overlay shows on every page reload (forced)

- 4 CTA buttons may create decision paralysis
- "Campaign" language sounds promotional, not consultative
- No urgency or scarcity elements
- Missing social proof/trust indicators
