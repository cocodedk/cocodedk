# Project Cards Update Plan

## Overview

Updated cocode.dk service cards to focus on hot trending technologies and services: AI Integration, MCP Development, OpenAI Integration, Fullstack Innovation, Spec-Driven Development, Cybersecurity Audit, and FITS.DK partnership.

## Card Structure Changes

### Removed Cards
- Python (too granular)
- Django (too granular)
- Flask (too granular)
- TypeScript (too granular)
- Neo4j (consolidated into Fullstack Innovation)
- Software (replaced with specific hot topics)
- Cybersecurity (replaced with Cybersecurity Audit)
- Clients (generic)
- Vibe Coding (renamed to Fullstack Innovation)
- Website Builder (not relevant)
- AI Wrappers (consolidated into AI Integration)

### Kept Cards
- **cocode.dk** - Updated description to highlight hot topics
- **Contact** - Enhanced with modern CTA
- **GitHub** - Updated with MCP/AI project references
- **LinkedIn** - Enhanced professional description

### New Hot Topic Cards

1. **AI Integration** - LLM integration (GPT-4, Claude, Mistral)
2. **MCP Development** - Model Context Protocol servers
3. **OpenAI Integration** - Specific OpenAI/GPT work
4. **Fullstack Innovation** - Modern Django + React/TS development
5. **Spec-Driven Development** - API-first, OpenAPI approach
6. **Cybersecurity Audit** - Enhanced compliance audits
7. **FITS.DK** - Partnership with lvl7.dk

## Content Strategy

### Each Card Includes
- Clear value proposition
- Technologies/frameworks used
- Real-world impact examples
- Call-to-action (GitHub link, contact)
- Emojis for visual interest
- Multi-language support (11 languages)

### Example Content Pattern
```
[Brief tagline describing what]
[How it works - 2-3 sentences]
[Technologies and approach]
[CTA with link]
```
