# Hi, I'm Babak

26 years of building software. 5 in cybersecurity compliance. Now I make AI do the work nobody wants to do.

## The problem I solve

Businesses run on repetitive tasks. Someone copies data between systems. Someone checks compliance spreadsheets. Someone schedules across three calendars. Every week, same thing.

I replace those tasks with AI agents. Not chatbots. Agents that plug into the tools you already have and get things done without asking. The goal is simple: your team spends time thinking, not copy-pasting.

I also audit AI systems for EU compliance (GDPR, DORA, NIS2, EU AI Act) because nobody should have to choose between automation and regulation.

## Where I'm headed

AI agents that run entire workflows end to end. Not one task at a time, but chains of decisions, actions, and validations that used to need a person in the loop. The future is fewer manual steps, faster feedback, and systems that optimize themselves. I'm building toward that.
