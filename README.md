# Hi, I'm Babak

Software developer for 26 years. The last 5 spent in cybersecurity compliance. Now I build AI agents that connect to real business systems and pass audits.

Based in Copenhagen. I speak English, Danish, and Persian.

## What I'm working on

I build MCP servers that let AI assistants talk to your tools. Three in production so far:

| Project | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| [Planner Task Creator MCP](https://github.com/cocodedk/Planner-Task-Creator-CLI-MCP) | Connects AI to MS Teams Planner. OAuth, task management, smart plan resolution. |
| [Calendar Consolidator MCP](https://github.com/cocodedk/calendar-consolidator-mcp) | Merges Microsoft 365 and iCloud calendars into one view. |
| [CodeScan](https://github.com/cocodedk/codescan) | Scans codebases, maps them in Neo4j, exposes the graph to AI via MCP. |

I also co-built [FITS.DK](https://fits.dk) with lvl7.dk, a compliance platform that runs AI-powered gap analyses against ISO27001, CIS v8, GDPR, and more.

## How I work

I wire AI into the systems businesses already use. Not chatbots. Agents that create tasks, consolidate calendars, scan code, and generate compliance reports. The kind of stuff that saves hours every week.

I audit AI systems too. Most consultants do one or the other. I do both because compliance mapping is a graph problem, and I've been building with Neo4j long enough to know that.
