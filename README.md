# Hi, I'm Babak

I've been writing code since 2000. Spent the last 5 years in cybersecurity compliance. Got tired of watching people do the same tedious work every week, so now I build AI agents that do it instead.

## What I actually do

Most of the work in a business is boring. Copying data between systems, updating compliance spreadsheets, juggling calendars. I build agents that handle that. They plug into MS Teams, calendars, codebases, whatever you're already using.

I also audit AI systems for EU regulation (GDPR, DORA, NIS2, EU AI Act). Turns out it's useful to be the person who both builds the agents and knows what the auditors will ask about them.

## Where this is going

Right now most AI agents do one thing at a time. I'm more interested in chains: an agent makes a decision, acts on it, checks the result, adjusts. Full workflows without a person clicking "approve" at every step. That's what I spend most of my time on these days.
